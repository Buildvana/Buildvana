## What is Buildvana

The Buildvana project is an effort to achieve out-of-the-box, automated DevOps for .NET projects, enforcing good practices while avoiding any waste of time.

It includes a [MSBuild SDK](https://github.com/Buildvana/Buildvana.Sdk) and a series of template repositories to get a new project completely set up in no time.

All Buildvana projects are released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

**NOTE:** Buildvana is still a work in progress, so all standard disclaimers apply. However, it was already used for internal projects at Tenacom, before it even became a project of its own.

### Why Buildvana

**TODO**

### Who should use Buildvana

The typical Buildvana user is a freelance developer or small team, with no dedicated DevOps personnel and no time to waste. The project's main focus is on open-source, but private projects are supported too.

Buildvana is also good for hobby or side projects that have growth potential, as they'll be ready to scale up when it's time.

### The Buildvana method

Buildvana is not only software, and as far as software goes, it is strongly opinionated. The use of Buildvana implies specfic ways to manage a project, from versioning to branching to handling pull requests and so on. The set of procedures involved, which will be described in Buildvana's documentation, constitutes the **Buildvana method** and reflects, at least in part, how we work at Tenacom.

## What Buildvana is NOT

Buildvana is not meant to solve all problems for everybody:

- if you have a DevOps team, a testing team, and a QA team, you've already outgrown Buildvana's target by a long shot;
- if you follow Agile methodologies, you might find the Buildvana method to be a bad fit, although you're welcome to use any Buildvana project you deem useful;
- if you are a hobbyist, working alone on very small projects, you may find Buildvana a bit overkill at first, but you're warmly invited to try it nonetheless.
